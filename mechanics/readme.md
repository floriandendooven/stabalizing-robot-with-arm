The CAD model of the robot arm and the test platform can be found here: <a href="https://kuleuven-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/florian_dendooven_student_kuleuven_be/EohYlxI3fyZGs-XbMR1dowYBnD4Z7l4FaRS5HoY3IXcrNA?e=O4NCej"> CAD model </a> <br />
With this files the 3d prints can be found and the wooden plates that have to be cut with a laser cutter. The assembly is straight forward with the CAD model next to you or with this 'video'. All information about the type of screws, threaded inserts etc can be found be searching the name of the part on the site of <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/"> McMASTER-CARR </a>. <br />
